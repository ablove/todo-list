# Todo List Application

This is a simple **Todo List** application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **add, edit, and delete tasks**, with tasks saved in **local storage** to persist even after a page refresh.

## Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 🔄 Tasks persist even after refreshing the page (saved in `localStorage`)

## How to Run

1. **Download or clone** this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ablove/todo-list.git
   ```

2. Open index.html in any web browser.
   How It Works

   Add a Task: Type a task in the input field and click "Add".
   Edit a Task: Click the "Edit" button next to a task, modify it in the prompt, and save.
   Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.
   Persistent Storage: The tasks are automatically saved, so they remain after you refresh the page
